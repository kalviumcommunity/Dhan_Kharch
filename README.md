# DBMS Project: Dhan Kharch

## **Project Idea**

The proposed project aims to develop an Expense Manager, a database-driven solution for managing personal expenses efficiently. Unlike a web-based application, this Expense Manager will solely rely on a MySQL database to record, categorize, and retrieve expense-related information. It will provide users with a command-line or script-based interface for interacting with the database.

## **Plan to Incorporate DBMS Concepts**

Here is how I plan to incorporate the specified DBMS concepts into this project:

* **Schema & ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram):**
  * Design a structured database schema for expenses, categories, and users.
  * Create an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visualize schema relationships.
* **DDL Commands (create, alter, drop):**
  * Use DDL commands to create, modify, and delete database objects.
* **DML Commands (select, insert, update, delete):**
  * Implement data operations like inserting expenses, updating records, and deleting expenses.
* **Relational Data Model and Normalization:**
  * Apply normalization techniques for data integrity and minimize redundancy.
* **Advanced SQL Queries (Joins, subqueries):**
  * Develop SQL queries for insightful expense reports and summaries.
* **Indexing and Query Optimization:**
  * Optimize query performance through indexing and efficient query design.
* **Transaction Control Language Commands:**
  * Ensure data consistency and integrity using TCL commands like COMMIT and ROLLBACK.
* **Role-Based Access Control:**
  * Implement role-based access control to restrict user access and permissions.
* **Database Security and Authorization:**
  * Secure user data with authentication, password hashing, and access controls.
* **Schema Evolution and Version Control:**
  * Provide mechanisms for evolving the schema and managing schema versions.

## **Timeline**

The proposed timeline for this project is as follows:

* **Week 1: Planning and Design**
  * Define database schema and document it clearly
  * Plan DDL commands and schema evolution strategy
* **Week 2: Development**
  * Implement database schema using DDL commands
  * Develop basic command-line/script-based functionalities using DML commands
* **Week 3: Advanced Features and Optimization**
  * Implement advanced SQL queries, indexing, and query optimization
  * Set up role-based access control and database security
* **Week 4: Finalization and Testing**
  * Complete schema evolution and version control mechanisms
  * Perform thorough testing and debugging
* **Week 5: Documentation and Presentation**
  * Document the project, including schema design, security measures, and usage instructions
  * Prepare for the final project presentation and review

## **Conclusion**

The Expense Manager project offers an excellent opportunity to apply a wide range of DBMS concepts to create a practical and efficient solution for managing personal expenses. While it won't have a graphical user interface, it will enhance our understanding of database design, normalization, DDL and DML commands, query optimization, security, and schema evolution. This project will provide valuable experience and deliver a powerful tool for personal financial management, solely residing within the MySQL database.
